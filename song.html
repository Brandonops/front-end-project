        <p class="lyrics mt-3" id="lyrics">I got my driver's license last week
            Just like we always talked about
            'Cause you were so excited for me
            To finally drive up to your house
            But today I drove through the suburbs
            Crying 'cause you weren't around <br>
            And you're probably with that blonde girl
            Who always made me doubt
            She's so much older than me
            She's everything I'm insecure about
            Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
            'Cause how could I ever love someone else?<br>
            And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
            And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
            Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
            'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <br>
            And all my friends are tired
            Of hearing how much I miss you, but
            I kinda feel sorry for them
            'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do, yeah
            Today I drove through the suburbs
            And pictured I was driving home to you<br>
            And I know we weren't perfect
            But I've never felt this way for no one, oh
            And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay, now that I'm gone
            I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
            'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street<br>
            Red lights, stop signs
            I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
            Can't drive past the places we used to go to
            'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
            Sidewalks we crossed
            I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
            Over all the noise
            God, I'm so blue, know we're through
            But I still fuckin' love you, babe (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)<br>
            I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
            And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay, now that I'm gone
            'Cause you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
            'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
            Yeah, you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

            Cher (born Cherilyn Sarkisian; May 20, 1946) is an Oscar- and Grammy-winning American singer and actress. A major figure for over five decades in the world of popular culture, she is often referred to as the Goddess of Pop for having first brought the sense of female autonomy and self-actualization into the entertainment industry. She is known for her distinctive contralto and for having worked extensively across media, as well as for continuously reinventing both her music and image, the latter of which has been known to induce controversy
