      <h2>Artist Summary:</h2>
      <p>"Cher (born Cherilyn Sarkisian; May 20, 1946) is an Oscar- and Grammy-winning American singer and actress. A major figure for over five decades in the world of popular culture, she is often referred to as the Goddess of Pop for having first brought the sense of female autonomy and self-actualization into the entertainment industry. \n\nShe is known for her distinctive contralto and for having worked extensively across media, as well as for continuously reinventing both her music and image, the latter of which has been known to induce controversy.\n\nCher was born Cherilyn Sarkisian in El Centro, California, on May 20, 1946. She is of Armenian-American, Irish, English, German, and Cherokee ancestry. Cher first caught the eye and ear of the public in 1965 as one-half of the pop rock duo Sonny & Cher, which popularized a peculiar
         smooth sound that competed successfully with the predominant
          British Invasion and Motown Sound of the era. After a period
          in which the duo became obsolete, she re-emerged in the 1970's
           television personality with her shows The Sonny & Cher 
           Comedy Hour and Cher, which attained great popularity.\n\nAt 
           ame time, she established herself as a solo artist with hits
            such as \"Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)\", \"Gypsys, 
            Tramps & Thieves\", \"Half-Breed\", and \"Dark Lady\", which
             dealt with taboo subjects in mainstream popular music. Throughout, she cemented her
              status as a fashion trendsetter with her daring outfits, and was noted as being the
               first woman to expose her navel on television. Cher's impact at that time, as described
                by Phill Marder from Goldmine magazine, \"led the way to advance feminine rebellion in
                 the rock world,\" as she was \"the prototype of the female rock star, setting the
                  standard for appearance and [...] attitude[.]\"\n\nIn 1983 Cher made a critically 
                  acclaimed appearance on Broadway and starred in the film Silkwood, which earned her
                   a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. In the following 
                   years, she became an acclaimed film actress by starring in a string of hit films,
                    including Mask, The Witches of Eastwick, and Moonstruck, for which she won the
                     Academy Award for Best Actress in 1988. At the same time, she established herself 
                     as a \"serious rock and roller\" by releasing a series of rock albums and hit 
                     singles such as \"I Found Someone\", \"If I Could Turn Back Time\", and \"The
                      Shoop Shoop Song (It's in His Kiss)\".\n\nShe made her directing debut with 
                      the film If These Walls Could Talk in 1996 and released the biggest-selling
                       single of her career thus far, \"Believe\", which revolutionized the recording
                        industry because of its pioneer use of Auto-Tune (also known as the \"Cher
                         effect\"). Throughout the 2000's she embarked on a series of concert tours
                          that were among the highest-grossing of all-time.\n\nCher has won an Academy 
                          Award, a Grammy Award, an Emmy Award, three Golden Globe Awards, and the Best
                           Actress Award at the Cannes Film Festival for her work in film, music and
                            television. She is the only person  to receive all of these awards. She 
                            is also the only artist to have notched a number-one single on a
                             Billboard chart in each of the past six decades. Recognized as one of
                              the best-selling music artists of all time, she has sold more than 100
                               million solo albums worldwide and 40 million records as part of Sonny
                                & Cher.\n\nOfficial website: http://www.cher.com/
